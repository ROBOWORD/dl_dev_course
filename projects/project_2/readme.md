This notebook is a project to do image search with keras. 
The model file a2-40b.h5 was created with a cnn in keras on 40 classes with 5,000 samples. It is then used as the base model to do image search on 60 never-before-seen classes.
All the classes are from a quickdraw dataset. As the dataset files are too big, they are not included here, but can be downloaded from https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data
